dRepanalyzer is a tool that can compute a resampling procedure and produce a rarefraction plot based on input files produced by dRep and CheckM softwares. This script is a project developed by students of a Molecular Biology Master's Programme at the University of Padova, during the lab classes in course Microbial Metagenomics. The project was developed under the supervision of Prof. Stefano Campanaro. 

The objective of this script is to produce a rarefraction plot which underlines the abundance of samples needed to dissect the microbial environment structure.

Requirements to run this script are: The software was developed based on python 3.10. It requires several common libraries. To discover if a system has the right requirements, run -check_dependencies.
